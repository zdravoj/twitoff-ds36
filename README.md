## How to Use the App

**Twitoff!** is a web app where a user can input a number of twitter users, provide some text, and determine which of two selected users is more likely to have tweeted the text.

### Updating Tweets

Twitter is lively - their users are constantly tweeting, and those tweets change how the app makes its predictions. To ensure that the predictions use the most up-to-date tweets, **click the orange "Update Tweets" button in the top right corner of the page**.

### Adding Users

On the right side of the home page, under "Users", click on the text block containing the text "User to add". A blinking cursor will appear in the text block. **Type the twitter handle of the user you wish to add, then click the blue button that says "Add User".** *NOTE: You do not need to include the "@" symbol in the twitter handle.* 
Whenever you successfully add a user, the app will display a message confirming that the user has been successfully added. Click "Twitoff!" in the top left corner to return to the home page.

### Comparing Text to User Tweets

Once you have added two or more users, you can **select two users from the dropdown text blocks on the left of the page** under "Home". To select a user, click anywhere in the dropdown text block, then select a username from the dropdown.
*NOTE: You cannot compare a user to themselves. If this is attempted, you will receive a message that a user cannot be compared to themselves. Click "Twitoff!" in the top left corner to return to the home page.*
Click on the text block containing the text "Tweet text to predict". A blinking cursor will appear in the text block. **Type the tweet text you would like to compare, then click the blue button that says "Compare Users".**
You will be redirected to a new page informing you of which selected twitter username is more likely to have made the tweet text you typed. Click "Twitoff!" in the top left corner to return to the home page.

### Clearing User Data

Help us keep the web app tidy! Before you leave, **click the "Reset Database" button in the top right corner of the page**. This will delete all twitter users, and their tweets, from the app. *NOTE: This doesn't delete the users or their tweets from anywhere except the web app. If you would like to add these users again, follow the same instructions for adding users.*
